## Terminology
The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", "RECOMMENDED",
"OPTIONAL", and "REQUIRED" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119.

## Overview

## Sphinx Cryptographic Packet Format Specification

### Threat Model
This is the threat model that was presented in (link to OG paper) and (link to Kate and Goldberg paper). 

__Author's Note__: It is, at the moment of this writing, unclear what Libp2p's threat model is. As such, when the threat model for libp2p has been established, this section should be updated to take that into account.

### Cryptographic Primitives
This section describes the cryptographic primitives used in the Sphinx packet format.
